# ETHRome 2023

The first IRL web3 hackathon in Rome focused on governance and privacy-preserving technologies.
Date: October '23 (TBD)


## Tracks

1) **Governance & Privacy**:
this is the main track of ETHRome '23. A unique track that combines some of the most popular tech trends of the moment: 
on-chain organizations, DAO tooling, and privacy-preserving solutions such as Zero-Knowledge proofs, anonymization techniques, perfect forward secrecy, and encrypted communication tools.

2) **General**:
all projects that do not fall under the first track are eligible. It can refer to any EVM-related topic such as DeFi, public goods, security, and games.


## Bounties
Besides the track, hackers can select sponsor bounties to apply to. All bounties can theoretically be chosen for both tracks. Until May 31, only those who are sponsors can propose a bounty.
